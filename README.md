I have completed assignment in Jupyter notebook and you can see my output by clicking the file directly on github. However if you want to run this on your system you can either use jupyter notebook or google colab. <br>

The assignment is for weather prediction. I have done visualisations and various prediction models. Also added some descriptions between the code and the final conclusion talks about all of the prediction models that I have used in this task.
